# Session 2

## Quick Recap 

- Intellisense & code completion
- Fail fast - Strong IDE support for spotting errors
- Additional features like enums and inhertitance. Also public, private and protected class members

## A Quick Test

<details><summary>How do you define a const with a type?</summary>
<p>

### You got it :grin: 
```TypeScript
const firstName: string = 'Winner winner';
```
</p>
</details>
<details><summary>What is an interface?</summary>
<p>

### Yep! :open_mouth: 
An interface contains the name of all an objects properties along with their types. It also includes the signature for functions along with the arguments and return type.
</p>
</details>
<details><summary>Can you import a JavaScript file?</summary>
<p>

### Of course! :unamused: 
This is no problem, variables will have the `any` type. You can write a definition file to retrofit types for the JavaScript if you want to.
